CIV6000 – Advanced   Engineering   Research Study
MSc   Dissertation   HANDBOOK
October 2023
1.      IntroductionThe    module    CIV6000    -    “Advanced    Engineering    Research    Study”      represents    a      major   element   of   the   Master   of   Science   (MSc)   programme   and   aims   at   enabling   participants   to   learn skills   in scientific investigation and in   running   and   presenting   a   project.During Semester   1, each student will be assigned a supervisor and a dissertation topic, on   which they will work throughout the year   and   full-time   from   June   through   August.   Students will   have to   maintain   regular contact with their supervisor to ensure satisfactory   progress of   the work.CIV6000      stems      from      the      “Professional      and       Research      Skills”       (CIV61005)      module   component,   which   is   carried   out   during   Semester   1   and   the   first   part   of   Semester   2.   As   a   part   of   the   CIV61005   coursework,   students   will   develop   a   plan   for   the   work   they   will   carry   out for CIV6000 during the   summer.At   the end of   the CIV6000 module, students are required   to submit a comprehensive report,   or   dissertation,   describing to   a very   high   standard the   individual work   that   they   have   done   during   the   summer   semester.   The   assessment   of   the   report   will   be   made   after   an   oral   interview taking place in late August or   early   September   2024.   The   report   and the   interview   assessments   will   count   for   95%    and   5%   of   the    mark,    respectively.    Attendance    at    the   interview   is compulsory, and the module is failed   if the   interview   is   missed.This document contains detailed   information   regarding the   requirements for   production of   the dissertation document, along with additional general   advice.   Further   details   on   relevant   issues,   such   as   plagiarism, will   be covered   in   CIV61005.   Students   need to   be familiar with   the points presented in this document, as well as the module assessment criteria, which are   provided in Appendix   A.CIV6000   is   formally   an   all-semesters   module,   but   most   of   the    research   study   will   be   conducted during the summer. Students must be aware that 10 credits should be equivalent   to   100   hours   work,   so   they   should   expect   to   spend   around   600   hours   working   on   their   dissertation project.CIV6000   is   intrinsically connected to the CIV61005   module   running   in Semester   1,   as the   research   proposal   forms   a   main   coursework   element   of   CIV61005.   Students   are   strongly   advised   to   discuss   their   proposed   project   time   planning   with   their   supervisor   at   an   early   meeting.   This   is   to   ensure   supervisors   are   aware   of   such   planning,   so   that   restrictions   to   students   and   supervisors’   availability   for   meetings   can   be   discussed   and   mutually   agreed   early on.Students must be aware they are responsible for organising meetings with their supervisor   and   to   be   prepared   for   those   meetings.   It   is   unlikely   they   will   be   able   to   receive   useful   feedback    between    meetings.    This    requires      making      progress    on      their      project      between   meetings.Different students and   projects will   require different amounts   of time   with   their   supervisor.   Typically,   students   will   meet   once   a   fortnight   although   this   may   vary   depending   on   the   project, with some meeting more frequently at key points. At an absolute minimum, students   must   meet   their   supervisor   three   times   per   semester.   Any   student   struggling   to   meet   with   their supervisor should contact the Student Support   Office.


2.      Project AllocationAt the   start of   Semester   1, students will   have   the   chance   to   express   their   preferences   on   the dissertation topic from a large list of titles   and   project   descriptions   outlined   by   academic   staff. The allocated dissertation topic will be based on   such   choices   and   will   be   released   by   Week 7 of   Semester   1.
2.1.   Self-Proposed   Projects
Students   have   the   option   to   self-propose   a   project.   Self-Proposed   Projects   require   the   submission of an ‘Expression of   Interest’   (EOI) for consideration.   Students   on   scholarshipsare   required to   propose their   own   project   if their   scholarship   requires them   to   work   on   a   specific   dissertation   area.   If   such   an   option   is   not   taken,   they   may   end   up   being   allocated a project that does not   meet their scholarship   requirements.Submitting   an   EOI   does   not   exempt   students from   expressing their   preferences from the   dissertation   topic   list,   as   there   is   no   guarantee   that   a   self-proposed   project   is   accepted.   Project preferences will be disregarded only   if an   EOI   is   accepted.The EOI   form   for self-proposing is posted at:https://forms.gle/Xfs75UNCbpBSaZxV6
and   needs to be submitted by   Monday of Week   5   (9am,   23   October   2023)   A self-proposed project will be considered against the following   points:
1.    Will    the       project    allow      the      student      to       meet    all      the       learning      outcomes    for      the   dissertation?    It    is    important   that   a   self-proposed   project   honours   the   key   criteria   based on which it will be marked, to   ensure   no   disadvantage   for   the   student.2.      Does the Department have the technical skills to supervise the student appropriately?
3.      Does   the Department have   the   facilities needed by   the student   to carry out   the project.   A self-proposed project   EOI will   include:
□       Brief   Project   Description   (not exceeding   400   words)
□       Subject area   (Geo,   Water, Structures,   or   Other   if   this   area   is   unknown)
□       Suggested Supervisor. Students should   look   up   the   department   research   web   pages   and the staff pages to identify a   potential   project   supervisor.   Potential   supervisors
should be contacted in   advance of   the   EOI   submission.
□       Lab time:   if this   is   necessary, students   need to   provide   a   rough   estimate   of the   amount   of   lab time   required by the   project.
□         Health and Safety   implications
Students should consider the following points when writing the   Project   Description:


1. Aims
Concise explanation of what the student hopes to achieve at the end of the project.
2. Introduction (or Background)
Description of the context or broader setting of the project, and why that is important. Indicate broad details of the project rationale (motivation), the problems/issues being addressed, the critical need for investigation, the nature and the purpose of research. The basic questions to be addressed are: why is such research needed, and what is being done in it?
3. Methodology
Broad overview of the research objectives. Description of approach taken to achieve them (e.g., simulation, experimental or theoretical?), with some details on the need and suitability of it.
5. Lab resources


Description of experimental work, if applicable (equipment, materials, lab time)
6. Health and Safety Issues
While an actual formal health and safety risk assessment will be completed in due course, the student needs to merely demonstrate awareness of relevant Health and Safety issues and advance a plan to address them.
7. Indicative references
List of References for sources of information cited in the text.





NOTE: At this stage, the description in the methodology section of the EOI form. can be very   brief (it will be finalised later). It is however very important to provide an estimate of the hours   required for laboratory support, if needed, which the student should discuss in advance with   their potential supervisor.
3.       Research   ProposalIn   the   module   CIV61005-Professional   and   Research   Skills,   which   starts   in   Week   1   of   Semester   1,   students   will   develop   a   dissertation   research   proposal   under   the   guidance   of   their dissertation supervisor. While this   proposal   is   due   in   Week   2   of   Semester   2,   students   are   expected   to   work   regularly   during   Semester    1,   as   soon   as   their   dissertation   title   is   assigned.The goal of the   proposal   is to   lay out   a feasible   working   plan   for   their   allocated   CIV6000   project   work   and   receive   early   formative   feedback   from   the   supervisor.   Supervisors   will   provide their feedback within two-three weeks after the submission deadline. The assessed   work is expected to be a concise summary of the student proposed plan for   Semester 2 and   the   summer.   Experience   suggests   that   the   more   the   initial   planning   the   less   the   stress   student experience   later when the CIV6000 study is conducted.The proposal will consist of   a word-processed report, not exceed 1500 words as specified   in   Section 4.   Such   a document   must   be formatted on A4   paper   with   at   least   2   cm   margins,   and   Arial   font    11.   Such   a   document   will   be   submitted   electronically   via    Turnitin    by   the   deadlines   given   in   Table   1.      A   proposal   template   is   provided   in   Section   4.   The   research   proposal assessment criteria are given   in   Section 3.

3.1.   CIV61005 Activities   and   Feedback
Students should be prepared to do the following   activities with their   supervisor   within   the   time frame. shown.Initial   Meeting   (Semester   1,   Weeks   8–9).   Students   will   meet   with   their   supervisor   to   start a discussion about the project they have selected and   identify   potential   research   ideas   they would like to   develop.Background   and   Literature   Review   (Semester   1,   Week   12).   Students   will   meet   with   their   supervisor   to   look   at   work   on   the   Background   and   literature   review   for   their   proposal   so   far. They should provide a structure for their sections highlighting the areas they   will   cover   and   evidence   of   the   literature   they   are   reviewing.   Some   of   the   literature   review   should   be   written   up fully, but it   is   not expected   to   be   in   the   final version.

Draft    proposal    review      (by      Semester      2,      Week       1).    Students      will      meet      with      their   supervisor, who will   look through their   proposal   briefly and   provide them with   key   points for   improvement. However, the supervisor will not be able to proof-read the whole draft and the   student   should   be   prepared   with   questions   about   key   areas   on   which   they   feel   advice   is   needed.   To   get   this   feedback,   students   must   arrange   to   meet   their   supervisor   before   the   end of Week   1 of semester 2. Supervisors   might   not   be   available to   see   the   students   in   the   same week when the proposal   is due.IMPORTANT   NOTE:   the   student-supervisor   meetings   are   not   timetabled!   Students   are   responsible for liaising well in advance with their supervisor to set up a time and a location   for these activities.
3.2.   Assessment   Criteria
The proposal will be assessed by the   supervisor   according to   the   following   seven   criteria:   
I.               Clarity of the   research question.
II.             Aims and objectives   are   appropriate   and   clearly   stated.
III.             Sufficient awareness of   project   context   and   rationale   relevance.
IV.             Appropriate awareness and   understanding of   the   relevant   literature.
V.             The methodology, methods, and   research design are   understood and   appropriate for the proposed   study.
VI.             Health   and   safety   matters   have   been   considered   in   sufficient   depth   that   there   is   a   reasonable basis to suggest   the work can be   conducted   safely.
VII.               Reference   list is complete and formatted correctly.
VIII.             Details    on    the    levels    of    assessment    for    each    of    the    above    criteria    are    given    in
Appendix   B.
3.3.   Dissertation   Proposal   Structure
A   structured description   of the   sections that   need to   be   included   in   proposal   is   provided   below.
PROJECT TITLE
Keywords: include a few words that define the essence of the proposed research. Ideally, these would be the relevant words that other researchers should enter in a search engine to get a better chanc代 写CIV6000 – Advanced Engineering Research Study 2023-2024
代做程序编程语言e of finding your study among the results. This section will not count toward the word limit.
1. Aims and Objectives (£100 words)
Explain in broad terms your aspiration, that is, what you hope to achieve at the end of the project. This part should be one or two paragraphs maximum. Keep them concise. Objectives are the steps taken to achieve the aims. Thus, you need to explain what you will do to achieve these aims. One to three objectives per aim, stated concisely. You might want to use a bullet list.
Objectives should be S.M.A.R.T., that is, specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time constrained.
2. Background (£200 words)
Describe the context or broader setting of your work. Use a few paragraphs, do not exceed 3-4 if possible.
Provide a broad description of the problems/ issues being addressed, the critical need for investigation, nature and purpose of research. The broad questions to be addressed are: why are you doing such research, what are you are doing in it?
3. Literature review (£500 words)
The overall goal is to present the state of the art in your specific area of research and explain how your work is going to advance it, that is, improve general knowledge in the field or perceived knowledge gaps.
As you are preparing for your dissertation you are likely to read more literature than is presented in the report, keep notes on the extra information and this may prove useful for your final literature review in your dissertation.
Make sure you present the most relevant sources of literature here that underpin why you have chosen your research area and approach. Remember this is a critical review, thus it important to express your opinion on previous work discussed.
4. Research Questions (£100 words)
Include concisely the major questions you set out to answer in your final year research project. These questions need to be specific, precise and concrete, as well as tightly linked to the aims presented in Section 1. Ideally, these questions will address knowledge gaps previously identified in the Literature Review (Section 3).
5. Methods (£200 words)
Describe your methodology, that is, the general strategy devised to address the problems/issues being addressed, and your methods, that is, the set of tools (e.g. numerical models, physical models, mathematical analysis, laboratory experiments, etc.) adopted to answer the posed research questions.
Normally the method description should be detailed enough for the reader to replicate your work. Thus ensure all details are given. In this preliminary report a less detailed outline is acceptable. You must also describe how your results can be trusted by the reader (i.e. use of scientific method such as controls, verification, validation, calibration, repeat tests etc).
6. Planning (£200 words)
You should include a project plan or Gantt chart as an appendix up to 2 pages long.
7. Risk Assessment (£100 words)
You should include a risk register of up to 2 pages long. As well as health and safety risks you should also consider risks to the project succeeding.
8. Outcomes (£100 words)
Explain what you expect to achieve in your project. This section must link back to the Objectives listed in Section 1.
9. Reference List
Include the full references to sources cited in the text using the Harvard referencing system; this section will not count toward the word limit.
APPENDICES
Include appendices to provide supplemental material to your proposal. Label them as Appendix A, Appendix B, … These parts are to be included only if necessary and will not count toward the page limit.

NOTE: the above layout is meant to provide general guidelines that students should follow   while   writing   their   dissertation   proposal.   Students   should   consult   with   their   supervisor   if   they think the sequence of sections should be modified.   However, all   sections   need to   be   presented.    In    addition,    word   count,   text    margins,    and   font    requirements    must    be    all   complied with.For further general guidance on writing dissertations and proposals, students should see   the   support   provided   by   the “301:   Academic   Skills   Center”   .   While   this   is   generic   guidance   for    all    departments,    most    of    the    information      is      applicable    to      research      in      engineering.   Following are two   useful   links:

4.      CIV6000 Timeline
Table 2 provides a complete   list of   important dates   and   deadlines.Dissertation. Students are typically expected to develop most of their dissertation study during   the Summer Semester. They are expected to work   full   time   on   their   project   starting   early   in   June   and until the end of August. No holidays are allowed over this   period. The dissertation will   be due   on 24 August 2024   (see Table   2).Interview. The dissertation is a major piece of individual research work that must be presented   in written form. to a very high standard and defended at an oral interview. The interview is normally   held between   late August and early September 2024   (see   Table   2).
5.      Aim of Individual   Research   projectThe   individual   research project   is   intended to enable students to develop   and   implement   skills   in   scientific   investigation,   creative   problem   solving   and   critical   evaluation   of   research   findings.   Students are also expected to develop   skills   in   technical   writing,   oral   presentation   of   research work, as well as time   and   resource   management for   the   successful   completion   of their work against   a   deadline.Students   must   be   aware   that   the   individual   research   project   is   the   keystone   to   their   degree.    Not only is it worth   a   substantial   number of   credits,   but   it   may   also   be   picked   up   as   a   potential   question   during   job   interviews.   The   project   provides   a   unique   opportunity   to   explore a single problem in tremendous   depth, practising skills   previously developed   during   the   MSc course. Students must ensure   to   make the   most   of   it.
5.1.   Learning   Outcomes
On successful completion of the final year project, students will   be   able to:
1.      Define the subject matter of the dissertation   and   its   relevance.
2.      Design, organise, justify, and operate   appropriate scheme to deliver   required goal.
3.      Employ appropriate scientific/design principles.
4.      Conduct and validate appropriate experimental technique/simulation model.
5.      Search   published sources of   information to   establish common   knowledge   and   to   develop   ideas further.6.      Discuss and analyse results and   formulate coherent conclusions on   the basis of   work done.
7.      Present   results/experimental evidence in an effective   manner.
8.    Write a structured technical dissertation following   a   prescribed   format.
9.      Demonstrate project, time, and   resource management skills.
The   learning   outcomes   1-3   are   related to   "Knowledge   and   Understanding," while   outcomes   4-9   pertain to "Skills and   Competence".NOTE:   The   above   learning   outcomes   will   be   assessed   through   the   final   report   and   the   interview   based   on   the   assessment   criteria   included   in   the   marking   Forms   included   in   Appendix   A.   Students   are   strongly   encouraged   to   carefully   study   the   above    learning   outcomes, as well as the assessment forms, and ensure they have addressed all learning   outcomes required for the   project.
6.      Assessment, Submission   Rules, and   Extenuating
CircumstancesAssessment   of   learning   outcomes   of   the   individual   research   project   will   be   carried   out   using the forms   in Appendix A.   In a   broadly similar fashion to   the   assessment   of   a   Ph.D.   or   M.Phil.   thesis,   the    project   will    be    assessed    in    its    entirety   with    a   single    mark,   with   the   assessors   reflecting on the student’s combined performance on three   individual elements:
□       Final   Report   (see assessment   criteria   in   Form   1,   Appendix   A);
□       Interview   (see assessment   criteria   in   Form   2,   Appendix   A).To   pass the   module   CIV6000, students should achieve at   least   a   threshold   level   for   each   learning   outcome   associated   with   each   deliverable.   A   grade   of   50   or   above   is   essential to be eligible for the award   of the   MSc   Degree.The student’s final report will be assessed by the supervisor and another member of staff,   not involved with the project, acting as a second assessor. The second assessor undertakes   an independent assessment of the level of performance demonstrated by the project report.   Both assessors will have   read the student’s report   prior to the   interview   and   will   have   made   notes   which   will   form   the   basis   of   questions   in   the   interview.   The   dissertation   report   and   performance at the interview   will count for 95% and 5% of the mark of CIV6000, respectively.   The    interview    is    normally      held    within    the      two      weeks      following      the      submission      of      the   Dissertation   (see   Table   2).   Attendance   at   the   interview   is   compulsory,   and   the   module   is   failed   if the   interview   is   not attended by the student.All   reports   should   be   submitted   via    Turnitin   by   the   specified   times   and   dates   given   in   Table   2.    The   penalty for   late   submission   of   the   final   project   report   is   a   reduction   of   5%   per day of   lateness with a cut-off (zero   score)   after   5   working   days   (in   accordance   with   University   wide   penalty   system, outlined   in   the   Departmental   Handbook).Students   must   be   extra   careful   not to   submit their dissertation   late,   as this   may   not   give   enough time to the two assessors to assess it thoroughly.   In addition, it may not be   possible   to   reschedule an interview if this conflicts with the   deadline for   the   final   mark   submission.
Where    extenuating      medical    or       personal    circumstances      occur      that       prevent    a   student from timely submission of work, they   should:
a)      Complete   an   Extenuating   Circumstances   Form.   This   is   available   from   the   Student   Support   Office   and   online.
b)    Take   this    promptly   to   the    Student   Support   Office   or   submit   electronically   to   civil-   [email   protected],   prior to the submission deadline.
c)      Notify their supervisor and the CIV6000 module   lead   instructor   (Domenico   Bau).
The   SSiD    website      gives    also    detailed    advice    on      what      to      do      in      the      case      of      medical   circumstances    (for    example      attending    the      University      Health      Service),      which      must      be   followed.       Additional       information       on          Extenuating       Circumstances       and          Requests       for   Assignment   Extensions can be found in the   Civil   Engineering Student   Handbook.IMPORTANT:   Delays   or   difficulties   connected   with   computing   will   NOT   be   accepted   as   valid   reasons   for   late   submission.   It   is   therefore   essential   that   students   keep   back-up   electronic copies of their work.
7.      Feedback
The   research   proposal   developed   in   CIV61005   (Section   3)   will   provide   a   formal   formative   feedback point as it will   be   marked   by student’s   own   supervisor.Following the completion of this,   it   is   up   to   the   student   to   discuss   with   their   supervisor   further   formative feedback needed on any subsequent project work and agree on appropriate timescales   for verbal feedback to progress with the project.By   virtue   of   the   independent   nature   of   this   project,   it   is   NOT   appropriate   for   supervisors   to   proof-read   the   chapters   of   final   reports.   However,   they   may   advise   on   the   content   of   smaller   sections,   as well   as give suggestions on   the   overall   proposed   report   structure   and   contents.   If   a   student wishes to   get this   support,   material   must   be   given to   the   supervisor   in   a   timely   manner.   Any   supervisor   is   likely   to   have   several   other   MEng,   MSc,   and   BEng   students   to   supervise,   as   well as other work commitments.   Hence, it will   not be   possible   to   provide   significant   feedback   on   material submitted to them a few days before the final   report   deadline!
In the two weeks following their dissertation interview, students may be able to obtain feedback   on their final report from their   supervisor.
